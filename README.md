A tiny demo using angular in a chrome extension.

## install as unpackaged extension

1. Open up your chrome extensions page by either choosing "Tools -> Extensions" from the Chrome context menu, or typing "chrome://extensions" into your browser address bar.
2. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and navigate to the source folder for this extension
3. Play and have fun.


## create extension

Once you're ready to pack the extension, it's as simple as clicking a button to create the .crx file.

## install extension

Because this extension is not being loaded from the Google store, you need to install it manually.

1. From within the Extensions page, drag the .crx file to the extensions page and accept any permissions.

Viola!
